# AdventofCode2022

Just my lame attempts at Advent of Code. 
I have completed years 2018, 2020, and 2021.

I am not a programmer by profession, but enjoy coding on my own time.

Update 1: I missed Day 3 and did Day 3 + 4 back to back starting at around 2 am. Day 4 took me about 15 minutes for both parts.

Update 2: Day 6 was a late start, but a good clear time.

Update 3: Late start on day 7, but the thing took me way too long. About an hour and a half... I was struggling with input working but code not. and the problem was duplicated folder names deeper in the structure.

Update 4: Day 8 seemed straight forward... but I overcomplicated it... I am noticing a trend. After I finally got part 1 when I realized I was doing something stupid, I figured out what I needed to do for part 2... then spun my wheels for 20 minutes before cluing in that I could put all the checks into a single return, because once it hits one true, it returned and didn't check other directions.

Update 5: Day 9 part 2 kicked my ass. had to rewrite my entire code because with 2 knots I had a weird hack that worked... and part 2... just didn't. Finally got there though.

Update 6: Day 10, started about 30 minutes late.. Part 1 I felt like I did okay on... but had to completely scrap it for part 2. After finishing part 2, I worked Part 1 into my part 2 solution easily enough.
