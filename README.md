# AdventofCode2022

Just my lame attempts at Advent of Code. 
I have completed years 2018, 2020, and 2021.

I am not a programmer by profession, but enjoy coding on my own time.

I missed Day 3 and did Day 3 + 4 back to back starting at around 2 am.
Day 4 took me about 15 minutes for both parts.
