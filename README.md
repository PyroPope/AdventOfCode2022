# AdventofCode2022

Just my lame attempts at Advent of Code. 
I have completed years 2018, 2020, and 2021.

I am not a programmer by profession, but enjoy coding on my own time.

Update 1: I missed Day 3 and did Day 3 + 4 back to back starting at around 2 am. Day 4 took me about 15 minutes for both parts.

Update 2: Day 6 was a late start, but a good clear time.

Update 3: Late start on day 7, but the thing took me way too long. About an hour and a half... I was struggling with input working but code not. and the problem was duplicated folder names deeper in the structure.

Update 4: Day 8 seemed straight forward... but I overcomplicated it... I am noticing a trend. After I finally got part 1 when I realized I was doing something stupid, I figured out what I needed to do for part 2... then spun my wheels for 20 minutes before cluing in that I could put all the checks into a single return, because once it hits one true, it returned and didn't check other directions.
